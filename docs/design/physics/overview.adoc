== Challenges

* Explosions
* Fluids
** e.g. water, magma
** Flow
** Pressure
* Gasses
** fog, smoke
* Lighting
* Projectiles
** accuracy
** wind
* Rigid body dynamics
* Temperature
** fire
** steam <--> water <--> ice

== Inspiration

* 2010 - Heat Transfer Simulation for Modeling Realistic Winter Sceneries
* Cogmind
** explosions, smoke, projectiles
* Dwarf Fortress
** Fluid simulation
*** Magma: flows down & spreads to the side
*** Water: magma + water pressure
** Fire
*** Magma ignites anything flammable
*** Creatures made of fire or magma
*** Dragon fire ignites or melts many fire-safe materials
